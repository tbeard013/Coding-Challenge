# Coding Challenge Documentation

This code utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in order to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using zip codes and display it.

The zip codes used in my program are listed below:
  - 29412
  - 10021
  - 90249
  - 68516
  - 99502

For each zip code, the city name, general weather conditions, atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed and direction, humidity and time of data retrieval is displayed.

I put comments throughout my code to describe how I accomplished this and why I chose to do it the way I did.

Here are some ideas I had to further improve the program with more time:
  - Add in a feature where the user can input a zip code of their choosing to see the data for their specified city
  - Add in more weather data available through the API
  - Add in more zip codes
  - Add a selection of buttons the user can click, each with different zip codes on them, so the user can choose to view just one location and its weather data at a time
  - Make the webpage more intricate and attractive
  - Add in more graphics and interactive features
